    "??? - How to best describe this\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation) where appropriate) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. \n",

    "Madison Metro Transit plans to redesign its bus system by August 2023. They're looking to increase access and bus frequency and decrease travel times to better meet the needs of Madison-area residents and businesses, while also being cost effective as per the proposed budget for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metro Transit transportation planner Mike Cechvala emphasizes on the need for this change as there hasn't been any significant remodeling of the system in the last two decades [\\[1\\]](https://badgerherald.com/news/2021/04/12/madison-metro-transit-plans-for-bus-system-redesign-to-improve-overall-quality/#:~:text=Madison%20Metro%20Transit%20will%20redesign,the%20experience%20of%20transit%20riders). He outlines some major problems in the Metro system which need to be solved. Some of these include cutting down on overlapping routes and replacing them with ones that serve the city more efficiently. Decreasing travel time will reduce vehicle miles and encourage a shift from cars to buses, which would also be in the interest of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has also been seen that the ridership has slowly declined for the last six years, with an even greater impact seen in the last couple of years due to COVID-19. We believe that a more efficient system will increase ridership and will allow Metro Transit to live up to its classification as a high-performing system, similar to bus systems in larger cities like Chicago and New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated? something you have collected personally, or by surveying your friends?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this problem we wish to solve comes from the City of Madison Open Data[\\[2\\]](https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/) hub. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This section should be 300-600 words long, and **should be accessible to a general audience** (don't assume your reader has taken the class!).

    "\n",
    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **We will be running your code**. Having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution will make it much easier for us to understand your project. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions. **Remember that if you do not write your description of the project and commeent your code well, we cannot understand what you have done. Even if it is technically brilliant, you will loose points if you do not write well and comment your code well.**\n",
